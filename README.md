# LucasBot
Some dumb bot I made because my friend wouldn't stop making puns out of my username

This project is free to be modified in any way, as long as I recieve credit if it is publicly published.

### To set up the bot
First, clone the repo:


`$ git clone https://github.com/CominAtYou/LucasBot`


Then, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).


After that, navigate to the repo you cloned earlier:


`$ cd <PATH/TO/REPO>`


Then, initalize node:


`$ npm install`


Then, open up index.js and fill in your token and bot logins.


Finally, to run the bot:


`npm start`
